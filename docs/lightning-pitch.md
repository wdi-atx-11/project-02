For Project 2, you will be working in groups of 3-4 to build a full-stack Rails application.

The instructional team will choose four project ideas from the class to determine the four groups. Everyone is encouraged to pitch an idea for Project 2. After hearing the pitches, you'll rank the ideas in order of preference. We'll use these preferences to pick the four project ideas and put together the groups.

**If you have an idea you'd like to pitch to the class, please follow these guidelines:**

1. Keep it VERY brief (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch" target="_blank">elevator pitch</a>). Your pitch cannot exceed 3 minutes.
2. Answer these questions:
  * What is your idea?
  * Who is it for, and why do they need it?
  * What technologies would you use that we haven't covered in class (if any)?
3. No slides. Use the whiteboard to draw any visuals you need.
